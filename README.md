# FoodApplication-User
This project is a fully functional Android-based Food Ordering Application developed using Kotlin, Firebase, and Android Studio. The app provides a smooth and user-friendly interface where users can browse food items, view details, add them to the cart, and place orders. It includes a complete authentication system using Firebase Authentication, allowing users to securely sign up, log in, and log out. User information such as name, email, phone number, and address is saved and fetched through Firebase Firestore, ensuring personalized experience every time the user logs in. The application also features a profile section where users can update their details, a cart section with total calculation and empty-cart animation, and a history section that displays previous orders. Additional UI features like image sliders, modern layouts, and Lottie animations enhance the overall design. This project is entirely created and managed by Nilesh Chandra, demonstrating strong skills in Android development, Firebase integration, and app UI/UX design..
